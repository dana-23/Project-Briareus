# Project Briareus 🐙

> **"Many hands make light work."**

Project Briareus is a **Multi-Agent Orchestrator** designed to handle complex user tasks by delegating sub-problems to specialized autonomous agents. Named after the Hecatoncheire (hundred-handed giant) of Greek mythology, this system acts as a central "brain" that coordinates a Researcher, Coder, and Writer to synthesize comprehensive outputs.

## 🏗 Architecture

The system operates on a hub-and-spoke model where a **Supervisor Agent** manages the lifecycle of a task. It does not perform the work itself; it intelligently routes tasks, critiques outputs, and synthesizes the final result.
